##Inspiration
There are various of Chinese characters. Some of them look similar, have the same pronunciation, or be a part of other characters, such as 云 is a part of 动, and I use Variant words to describe the words made of them.    
I use chinese characters feature to detect Variant words, and search Variant words about the input words in import text.
